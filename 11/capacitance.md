# Capacitance
## Capacitors
- Capacitors store charge
> Diagram 1
- Capacitors are components used in many elecrtical and electronic circuits. They store electrical charge. Capacitors are used in compputers, they are charged up in normal use and gradualy discharge if there is a power failure.
### Structure
- Two conducting plates that are normally rolled into a cylinder with insulating material between them.
- All capacitors have two leads, connected to two metal plates where the charge is stored. Between the plates is an insulating material called the dielectric.
### Charging
- To charge a capacitor it must be connected to a voltage. Electrons flow onto one plate leaving it negatively charged, negative charge is then repelled from the opposite plate.
## Capacitance
- One plate of the capacitor stores charge +q and the other stores an equal and opposit harge of -q. We say that the charge stored it q.
- If we connect the leads of the charged capacitor together the charge -q flows around to cancel out the +q and the capacitor is discharged.

### Energy stored
 - When you charge a capacitor you use a power supply to push electric charge onto its plates. You recover this energy stored by the capacity W (C) depends on two things - its capacitance C (F) and the potential difference to which it is charged V.
> Diagram 3
### IB Definition
 - Capacitance is defined as the charge stored per unit potential difference. Its unit is the farad (F). On farad is one coulomb per volt.
### Graphs
> Diagram 4
- Energy is equal to the area under the curve
- Capacitance is the gradient.
## Capacitors in series and parallel
### Series

## Discharging Capacitors
- Usually, capicitors are discharged over a resistor, otherwise the charge would just go straight from one plate to the other!
- Charge on a capacitor as it discharges through a resistor is;
> Diagram 7
- This is in the form of exponential decay
### Time constant
- The term CR is used frequently in capacitor circuits and is called the time constant $$tau$$, $$tau = RC$$
- Theoretically the charge on the plates never becomes zero as it decays exponentially. Therefore we take the time it decaus to $t = RC
> Definition of the time constant. The time constant is defined in a particular way, considering the discharging of a capacitor starting at potential difference v 0

### Exponential decay for current
- The corresponding equation for the current in the circuit is:
> Diagram 9
- The minus sign indicates discharge
