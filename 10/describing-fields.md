# Describing Fields
## Fields
> A field is said to exist when one object can exert a force on another object at a distance.

### Electric Fields
An electrostatic force exists between two charged objects 
There are two types of charge;
- Negative - *surplus* of electrons in the object
- Positive - *deficit* of electrons in the object
When two objects have the same *sign* of charge e.g $$+ and +$$, the force between them is **repulsive**.
Likewise, when objects have *opposite* signs e.g $$- and +$$, the force between them is **attractive**.
