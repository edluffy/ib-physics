# Describing Fields
## Fields
> A field is said to exist when one object can exert a force on another object at a distance.

### Electric Fields
An electrostatic force exists between two charged objects 
There are two types of charge;
- Negative - *surplus* of electrons in the object
- Positive - *deficit* of electrons in the object

When two objects have the same *sign* of charge e.g $$+,+$$, the force between them is **repulsive**.
Likewise, when objects have *opposite* signs e.g $$-,+$$, the force between them is **attractive**.

Remember, all electric of these electric charges give rise to an electric field around the object. Whenever a charge is in the field of another charge, an **electrostatic force** acts on it, *regardless* of its charge.

Electric Field Strength is equal to =
> $$\frac{force~acting~on~a~positive~test~charge}{magnitude~of~test~charge}$$

Furthermore, the direction of the field is the same as the direction of the force acting on a **positive charge**.
The unit of electric field strength is $$NC^{-1}$$.

### Gravitational fields
A gravitational force exists between two objects that both have mass.
Each object with mass has a gravitational field around it, which acts on other objects that also have mass.
- Unlike with electric fields, gravity is an **attractive** force, *repulsion* between objects with mass is never observed.

Gravitational field strength is equal to = 
> $$\frac{force~acting~on~test~mass}{magnitude~of~test~mass}$$

The direction of field strength is always towards the mass that gives rise to the field
The unit of gravitational field strength is $$N{kg}^{-1}$$.
